        <h2>Directions: </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Add coleslaw mix, green onions, and cilantro to a bowl. Whisk rice vinegar, 1 1/2 tablespoons sesame oil, <br>
                1 tablespoon Sriracha, 1 1/2  teaspoons soy sauce, and 1 teaspoon sesame seeds together in a cup.         <br>
                Pour dressing over slaw and toss to coat. Set aside to marinate, tossing occasionally, at least 30 minutes. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Whisk water, hoisin sauce, 1 tablespoon Sriracha, fish sauce, and 2 teaspoons sesame oil together in a large bowl; set aside. <br>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Heat a 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir pork in the hot skillet with a generous pinch <br>
                Kosher salt, breaking up pork with a spatula, until browned and crumbly and fat has rendered, 8 to 10  minutes. <br>
                Remove pork to the bowl with water-hoisin sauce mixture. <br>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Pulse mushroom pieces in a food processor until the size of green peas, 8 to 10 times. <br>
                Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in the same skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir mushrooms <br>
                with a generous pinch of salt until liquid has evaporated and mushrooms are beginning to <br>
                turn golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer mushrooms to the bowl with pork. <br>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, pulse onion chunks, bell pepper chunks, and jalape√±o together in the food <br>
                processor until vegetable mixture resembles pico de gallo, about 15 times. <br>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in the pan. Add onion mixture and a pinch of salt <br>
                and cook until onions are translucent and most of the liquid has evaporated, <br>
                5 to 7 minutes.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Process garlic cloves in the food processor until small enough that all the <br>
                bits are sticking to the sides, about 10 seconds. Stir garlic and ginger    <br>
                paste into the skillet with onion mixture and cook until fragrant, about 30 <br>
                seconds. Return meat and mushroom mixture to the skillet. Stir to combine; <br>
                simmer until meat is coated in a thick sauce and most liquid has evaporated, <br>
                10 to 12 minutes.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Mix mayonnaise and sesame oil in a small bowl. Spread a thin coat of mayonnaise <br>
                mixture inside of both top and bottom buns. Add to a nonstick pan and toast over <br>
                medium heat until golden, about 2 minutes. <br>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Top prepared buns with sloppy joe mix, coleslaw, cilantro leaves, <br>
                and a drizzle of Sriracha. Top with the other bun half. <br>
            </li>
            <br>
        </ol>
